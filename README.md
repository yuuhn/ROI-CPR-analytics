Obviously, the 2nd traffic source has best ROI figures among all on time span of 0, 7, 30 and 180 days. The 1st and the 3rd sources however differ from month to month, none returns investment from all months after half a year YET. The 3rd source performs slightly better than the 1st one and both look REALLY PROMISSING to gain above full return of investments in another couple of months.

## Comparing average dayly CPR through all traffic sources

One can notice, that throughout 6 months CPR is the lowest at the 2nd traffic source and the highest at the 1st one.
